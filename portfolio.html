            <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p> Hello! My name is Josh. I grew up in Grand Terrace, California but currently live in Kansas City, Missouri and have for the last 14 years. <br />
                    I am both a cat and dog person, but really I think all animals are really interesting, especially aquatic animals.<br />
                    I am a student of LaunchCode and am currently learning how to write JavaScript and HTML. <br />
                    I like tech and am looking to make a career out of that passion, and I believe LaunchCode is my best avenue to that end. <br />
                </p>
