    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p> Hello! My name is Josh. I grew up in Grand Terrace, California but currently live in Kansas City, Missouri and have for the last 14 years. <br />
        I am both a cat and dog person, but really I think all animals are really interesting, especially aquatic animals.<br />
        I am a student of LaunchCode and am currently learning how to write JavaScript and HTML. <br />
        I like tech and am looking to make a career out of that passion, and I believe LaunchCode is my best avenue to that end. <br />
    </p>
